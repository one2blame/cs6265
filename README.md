This class is an intense, hands-on security laboratory. As a student, I
practiced reverse engineering to discover security vulnerabilities in
executable files. This course covers the use of advanced techniques to write
exploits for different families of vulnerabilities. You can find my notes
related to this course at: [https://one2bla.me/the-dark-arts](https://one2bla.me/the-dark-arts)
